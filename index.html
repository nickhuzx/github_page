           <p name="2887" id="2887" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A most funny phenomenon in modern society is that, we walk dogs on the road, but we post about cats on the Internet.</p> 
           <p name="5cd9" id="5cd9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once you are connected to the Internet, you will find yourself bombarded with pictures and videos of cats. This fluffy animal has been playing an increasingly important role and displaying its existence more than ever.</p> 
           <p name="1f02" id="1f02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the UK, the average number of cat pictures people post on the Internet a day is 3,400,000, almost triples that of selfies. The craziness for cat is also the same in China.</p> 
           <p name="3fd2" id="3fd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Among the discussion about keeping cats and dogs in the famous Chinese Q&amp;A community Zhihu, discussion associated with cats accounts for over 70 percent.</p> 
           <p name="24d8" id="24d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, in the past year, a public account on Wechat named “We are Cataholics”, came first among tens of thousands of public accounts under the category of “Lohas”, with its startling reading amount reaching 210,000,000 times. To put it in another way, almost 16 percent of Chinese people have read articles from this Cataholic account once in the past year.</p> 
           <p name="1108" id="1108" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cataholics exist all over time, but it seems that the craziness for cat suddenly becomes so overwhelming, that if you own a cat, it means that you own the whole world. It’s like a new form of addictive drug, a drug that modern people cannot live without.</p>

           <p name="2acf" id="2acf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A year ago, Elaine never expected becoming one of the most envied type of people on social media, one who owns a cat.</p> 
           <p name="5e06" id="5e06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She didn’t even know how this craziness for cat suddenly bombarded the whole Internet, but did realize why she was so willing to nurse this fluffy master, “Bubble is sooooo cute!”</p>

              Elaine and Bubble at their&nbsp;home 
            </figcaption> 
           </figure> 
           <p name="0bd6" id="0bd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Bubble is a Garfield cat with a flat, round face, exactly the same with “The Garfield” except its grayish-brown fur coat. He is not an outgoing clingy cat, and likes to hide himself in Elaine’s bedroom.</p> 
           <p name="3514" id="3514" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“How can you restrain yourself from holding this fluffy cute angel,” Elaine exclaimed, “Their innocent faces will definitely shed your armor down and turn you into a loyal fan.”</p> 
           <p name="ba4a" id="ba4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is natural for Elaine to post about Bubble on Instagram every day. Bubble has become an important part of her life.</p> 
           <blockquote name="af08" id="af08" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">
             “He is so silly but cute! Envy me!” Elaine wrote on her recent post, with great satisfaction. 
           </blockquote> 
           <p name="8b09" id="8b09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">It’s true that cats’ cute appearances attract people, but there is more to this crazy “cat addiction”. If you ask a Cataholic why he or she cannot live without cats, nine out of ten will answer that it is actually the companionship and cure cat brings that they cannot live without.</p> 
           <p name="8919" id="8919" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In reality, what Bubble is to Elaine goes far beyond being a major character on Instagram.</p> 
           <p name="3b22" id="3b22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Elaine had never thought that someday she would have a cat. She even had never raised any fluffy animal before having Bubble, and her only experience about keeping pets was having a turtle and a goldfish that stayed in the fish tank all the time.</p> 
           <p name="f78b" id="f78b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“But having Bubble is definitely different. So different.” Elaine said.</p> 
           <p name="24d7" id="24d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Growing up in Guangdong and studying in Hong Kong for a Master’s degree, Elaine gradually got tired of the familiar land and decided to come to Beijing for work, but things weren’t the same as expected.</p> 
           <p name="446e" id="446e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For a long period of time, Elaine hated staying in the empty apartment after work, and didn’t come home until late. Fortunately, Bubble’s existence illuminates Elaine’s life.</p>

           <p name="80cb" id="80cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bubble looks silly because of his flat, round face, but Elaine thinks that he is actually clever and keen. Whenever she is in a low mood, Bubble will definitely notice that, and heal Elaine in his own way.</p> 
           <p name="2614" id="2614" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There was a period of time when Elaine was at the crossroads of life, and could not sleep very well at night. When Bubble heard that Elaine was turning over, he would climb up onto her bed and lie right beside her, asking her to scrub his fur.</p> 
           <blockquote name="0888" id="0888" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">
             “This means a lot to me. He becomes family, a kind of companionship.” 
           </blockquote> 
           <p name="7a8d" id="7a8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">When people have their own cat, they tend to be totally open and frank to their cat, displaying their fragile side, which has been hidden for a long time from other human beings.</p> 
           <p name="e14d" id="e14d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This kind of frankness was also rewarded. Cats play with you and rely on you, displaying all their cuteness and innocence only to you, which is the best and the most exclusive form of reward.</p> 
           <p name="9350" id="9350" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unlike Elaine, Xueshan, who is still a college student, does not have the luck to keep a cat at dorm, but it cannot stop her from regarding cats as an important source of emotional support. When Xueshan found that there were actually homeless cats on campus, she felt that she discovered great treasure.</p> 
           <p name="10f6" id="10f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Xueshan especially loves the cat with snow-white fur, and often deliberately passes by the road where it often appears. Meeting and touching “Snow-white” can “help sustain hours of studying”, and in the past month, there were 15 posts about cats in her Wechat Moments, mostly about Snow-white.</p>

           <p name="dc9d" id="dc9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">However, for those who cannot raise cats in real life due to various reasons, or meet homeless cats like Xueshan, watching cat videos or playing cat-raising games on the Internet becomes a good alternative.</p> 
           <p name="d499" id="d499" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">When seeing these cute little creatures dressing up like dolls and suddenly move their faces close to the camera, the stress and exhaustion of a long day’s work will sure disappear.</p>

           <p name="8a89" id="8a89" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Yuri is a genuine member of the “Internet Cataholics”. Preparing for the national entrance examination for postgraduates, Yuri was under great pressure, and cats then become her exclusive cheerleader. “Seeing pictures and videos of this fluffy little creature helps me a lot. They are little healers.”</p> 
           <p name="4ad1" id="4ad1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A cat a day keeps the doctor away. This is definitely true for Cataholics in modern society. Cats are new form of drugs, providing people an exit to get away from the tedious life, and sink themselves into the “planet of cuteness”.</p> 
           <p name="00b5" id="00b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s hard to describe this healing power of cats in concrete words, but its overwhelming effect is evident, just like how Elaine was dragged out of sadness when Bubble jumped onto her bed and scrubbed against her arm, how Snow-white Xueshan met acted as a good listener when she was in low mood, and how Yuri escaped from the stress of daily life through watching cat videos on her phone before sleep.</p> 
           <p name="58a8" id="58a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So what does cat bring us? Their cute appearance, and more importantly the cure and companionship they provide, might be the answer. Whether through interacting with real cats, or becoming an Internet Cataholic, there is no denying that cats are becoming an increasingly important source of cure for modern life.</p>

           <p name="36ef" id="36ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The secrets lie behind our time</strong></p> 
           <p name="b2e5" id="b2e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The love for cat is not new. Archaeological findings show that the history between human and cats dates back to more than 9,000 years ago.</p> 
           <p name="3354" id="3354" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In China, the earliest record about cats was in the Book of Songs, written 2,000 years ago. The large number of folk songs and poems about cats show that they were important and unique even in early people’s life.</p> 
           <p name="cf5d" id="cf5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lu You, a famous Chinese poet, was also lost in the charm of cat, expressing his love in many of his poems. In Song Dynasty, cat-keeping reached a historical peak, and cat food market even emerged.</p> 
           <p name="df32" id="df32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The love for cat has lasted for more than 2,000 years in China, and sure will never disappear. However, to describe the relationship between the new generation of Cataholics and their “soulmate-cat”, “love” wouldn’t be the right word. Instead, they are fanatical, aspirational, obsessive, and addictive to cats.</p>

           <p name="3502" id="3502" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The craziness for cats takes root in modern life.</p> 
           <p name="a38a" id="a38a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not difficult to sketch out this new generation of Cataholics — mostly in their twenties or thirties, well-educated but struggling in big cities, single and alone, dreaming about a perfect and successful life. As a result, the cuteness, cure and companionship cat brings can act as a good remedy to save them out of the tedious life.</p> 
           <p name="8b78" id="8b78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dogs are also cute, and have long been loyal friends of human beings, but why Cataholics are all over the Internet and the society, displaying a rather dominating position?</p> 
           <p name="2394" id="2394" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To be a bit extreme, Cataholics are somewhat “products of our time.” To describe the features of the new generation of Cataholics, a startling truth is that, it is closely related with what we hate, what we fear, and what we desire.</p> 
           <p name="1c83" id="1c83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unlike dogs, cats stand for the unbounded and free nature of self, and that’s what modern people desire most.</p> 
           <p name="36ac" id="36ac" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Sometimes I feel that being a cat is great,” Ziqin joked. Born in the 1990s under the One-Child Policy, Ziqin was used to living alone without brothers or sisters. She was described as “professional” and “independent” in work, but only herself knew that it was not easy to deal with all kinds of relationships in work, and in daily life.</p> 
           <p name="68fe" id="68fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, cats are free from the complicated ties and relationships that constrain modern people. For Ziqin, getting along well with colleagues, roommates, and family members takes much effort, but in her eyes, cats are living a totally different life. It seems that they have seen through everything, therefore cares about nothing.</p> 
           <p name="1767" id="1767" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Cats are only living for themselves,” Ziqin concluded, “but it is impossible for most people to follow”. As a young woman in career, it might be better for Ziqin to restrain personal characteristics.</p>

           <p name="a4f0" id="a4f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It’s hard for a grown-up to cut off all ties and say that “I care about nothing”, but that’s what every cat do. They do not flatter anyone for food or for love, and sometimes even ignore their hosts’ calls. “This is what I envy most,” Ziqin sighed.</p> 
           <p name="d030" id="d030" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Besides, the unbounded and independent nature of cats also suits the fast-pace life of modern people well. For the new generation of Cataholics, cats bring the necessary companionship and warmth without disturbing their work and independence, or adding pressure to the “already stressful” life.</p> 
           <p name="d79d" id="d79d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Elaine describes her relationship with Bubble as “interdependent, but independent”. This kind of relationship could never exist if Bubble were a dog.</p> 
           <p name="a64a" id="a64a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Working in a well-known Internet Company in Beijing, Elaine has a lot to deal with every day, and could not spare much time for Bubble. As a result, Bubble’s independent character suits Elaine’s busy calendar perfectly. It just takes Elaine a few minutes to prepare food and shovel Bubble’s poop before work every day, and she knows that Bubble will take good care of himself after she leaves.</p> 
           <p name="f31e" id="f31e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“But if you have a dog, you will feel very guilty if you do not take him out for a walk.” Elaine said.</p>

           <p name="6e5c" id="6e5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">When Elaine was doing her work at home, Bubble would always lie beside her laptop quietly, without disturbing. This is the unique form of companionship cat provides, a kind of companionship that leaves each other within his or her cozy boundary, but at the same time displays silent love and support.</p> 
           <p name="5bc6" id="5bc6" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I do not feel bounded by this kind of relationship,” Elaine added, “It’s even an ideal kind of relationship between lovers.”</p> 
           <p name="bc51" id="bc51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For Internet Cataholics, the bind is even lesser. They do not need to feed the cat, take it to the pet clinic, or shovel the poop every day, but can see these cute little creatures on social media and thus feel satisfied and lightened.</p> 
           <p name="28b5" id="28b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The unbounded relationship prevents all possible troubles that may lead to negative emotions, and suits modern people well, who are under too much pressure and need a way to vent their feelings.</p> 
           <p name="e548" id="e548" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cherie once kept a cat for her friend for about two weeks. “Cats are definitely angels,” Cherie said, “When they sit on your sofa, you feel that you need nothing more.”</p> 
           <p name="b1fd" id="b1fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Two weeks later, when Cherie had to say goodbye to this little angel, she felt that she lost a big part of her life. She wrote on Wechat, “A person who does not have a cat is like wild grasses”.</p>

The pleasure of actual interaction is less, but it does help avoid potential sadness, like saying goodbye.</p> 
           <p name="e63b" id="e63b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“There’s already too much pressure in life,” Cherie sighed, “and I cannot afford saying goodbye again.”</p> 
           <p name="cfb5" id="cfb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Becoming an Internet Cataholic is a good alternative for people like Cherie, who needs the cure from cats to relieve pressure, but also want to avoid excessive emotional costs. And because it suits so well the fast-pace life of young people who are struggling for success, that it has actually became a popular subculture on the Internet.</p> 
           <p name="11da" id="11da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are what we love. People become Cataholics because they could see traces of themselves from cats, and they tend to cast their own image onto the unbounded creature.</p>

The findings of Facebook Research proved this point. Data from 160,000 users showed that cat owners like to stay at home to watch movies or read books. Dog owners, by contrast, are more outgoing, with 26 more friends on average than cat owners.</p> 
           <p name="0548" id="0548" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lacking or hating actual social contact, Cataholics find that the Internet is a good alternative to fulfill their need to connect without creating much complicated ties, and at the same time realizing an ideal kind of connection based on common interest, which is the love for cats.</p> 
           <p name="ca27" id="ca27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With an anonymous ID that covers the real identity, Cataholics are finally set free on the Interent.</p> 
           <p name="8ff5" id="8ff5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A major way for Cataholics to connect with others and express themselves on the Internet is through producing and using “cat expression packages”.</p>

           <p name="7e88" id="7e88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cats actually have very few facial nerves, thus many of their facial expressions do not have real meanings. However, Cataholics tend to cast their own emotions onto cats, trying to provide an explanation or understanding for cats’ facial expressions in the form of words.</p> 
           <p name="f3a5" id="f3a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This self-casting and self-mapping of human emotions onto cats greatly promotes the production of countless number of cat expression packages from Cataholics. Also, because expressions of the cats together with the words could explain perfectly the emotions of human beings, more and more people who are originally not fan of cats start using these expression packages, which again contributes to the popularity of the Cataholic subculture.</p>

              Post-80s spent most on cats （via Ali&nbsp;Data）

           </figure> 
           <p name="e0b8" id="e0b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The post-80s spent 357 yuan for their cats each month on average, being the highest among all age groups.</p> 
           <p name="c864" id="c864" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Each month, Elaine spends nearly 300 yuan for Bubble. Besides normal cat food and cans, she sometimes feed Bubble with nutria-vita to ensure his health. However, the cat litter, food bowl and toys bought for Bubble are generally moderate in price.</p> 
           <p name="ad2f" id="ad2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Different from Elaine, a growing number of cat owners tend to provide high-end pet products for their ‘masters’. Thus, more brands are emerging to meet customers’ needs.</p> 
           <p name="a007" id="a007" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These brands claim to provide high-quality life for pets based on technology. Petkit, known for its sterile food bowl and smart water dispenser, is a representative one.</p> 
           <p name="d16b" id="d16b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The sales of the water dispenser have reached 4000 each month despite its price, with the cheapest one being close to 300 yuan.</p> 
           <p name="4cba" id="4cba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The comments of this product may reveal Cataholics’ mentality. “I don’t have to worry about the water quality for my cat anymore.” For Cataholics, cats are not simply animals, but deserve equality with human beings, like the need for high quality water.</p> 
           <p name="b139" id="b139" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Noticing the huge potential of this market, even some famous household brands begin to target Cataholics’ wallets.</p> 
           <p name="2cef" id="2cef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The well-known Swedish brand IKEA has already launched the pet furniture series, “Lurvig”, in the United States and Japan. Created by “pet loving designers”, as the official website described, this series is specially designed to keep the four-legged “family members” comfortable and occupied, including cat houses, slow-feed bowls, scratching mats and so on.</p>

           <p name="2e7c" id="2e7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Besides the influence on entity economy, the craziness for cats on social media has also led to the appearance of Fan Economy among Internet Cataholics. Celebrity cats on social media create new profitable opportunities.</p> 
           <p name="248c" id="248c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cat bloggers might initially want to share their daily life with cats, but fans soon accumulated to such a large number that drew the attention of advertisers.</p> 
           <p name="052c" id="052c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The most well-known pet blogger in China, “Hui Yi Zhuan Yong Xiaomajia”, has successfully made a packet by sharing his life with his cat and dog on Weibo.</p> 
           <p name="0788" id="0788" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So far, more than 29 million people have followed Xiaomajia, outnumbering the population of Shanghai.</p> 
           <p name="27d1" id="27d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This huge fan base led him to an offer from a professional Blogger company, providing him with comprehensive marketing strategies. Soon after, Xiaomajia began to sell calendars, books and other derivative products related to his cat.</p>

           </figure> 
           <p name="2185" id="2185" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The loyalty of his fans builds up gradually as time goes on. Currently, Xiaomajia posts various kinds of advertisements, including products that have nothing to do with his cat, like cars, and e-commerce website. By posting each piece of advertisement, Xiaomajia earns 20,000 yuan, which is almost three times the monthly salary of ordinary office workers in cities like Beijing or Shanghai.</p> 
           <p name="aedb" id="aedb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For most Internet Cataholics, derivative products of cats exert great attractions that they cannot deny. As a grown-up, Xueshan still bought herself coats with cat pictures on. “My dorm is too small. Every time I see these things, I have to try hard to stop myself from taking them all home.”</p> 
           <p name="8ccc" id="8ccc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Cataholic culture and the derived creative industries are far from saturation. Elements of cats can be grafted on almost everything. And more importantly, the majority of Cataholics are quite willing to pay for these fluffy friends who have brought them so much cure and warmth.</p> 
           <p name="c857" id="c857" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If getting a pillow with your favorite kitty on it can meet your psychological needs, then why not pay for it?</p> 
           <p name="f995" id="f995" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most cat bloggers share similar path with Xiaomajia. Once they have accumulated a certain number of fans by posting cute or funny pictures of their cats, they would be verified by Microblog as “famous pet blogger”. This guarantees more advertising opportunities.</p>

           <p name="bbff" id="bbff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Posts associated with Fox or Bun generally have more than 2,000 pieces of reposts and comments, and short videos like taking a bath for cats would gain around 5,000 pieces of interactions on average. If taking “likes” into account, the number may generally exceed 10,000. This scale of interaction has exceeded that of most celebrities’ Weibo accounts.</p>

There are many cat-themed public accounts, and “Here comes cat” is one of the most popular ones, which has attracted 500,000 fans in less than two years.</p> 
           <p name="efe5" id="efe5" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Here comes cat” profits mainly on advertisements, but also launches other forms of activities to build fan loyalty, like online cat-raising games.

           <p name="69ff" id="69ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The team of “Here comes cat” has clearly recognized the niche market introduced by the Cataholic subculture. Focusing on e-commerce and paid content, “Here comes cat” aims at producing a unique symbol of the Cataholic subculture, and expanding the love of cat to a larger range.</p> 
           <p name="04d8" id="04d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Besides Weibo and Wechat, social media like Instagram and vertical websites like Youtube, Bilibili, Zhihu are also popular platforms, gathering a large number of Internet Cataholics to watch cat videos and interact with other Cataholics in their own way.</p>
